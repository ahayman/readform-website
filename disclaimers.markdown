### Breakable

Readform may break at any time. It's not consuming any set API because there is none. Instead, it accesses the raw html and scrapes the data it needs from it. Because of this, there is no guarantee of of data consistency. Changes to a website's structure could easily break what Readform is doing. In most cases, any downloaded content will remain, leaving the app unable to retrieve new content.

If this happens, I will work to fix the issue as quickly as I can.

### No Ownership

I claim no ownership or responsibility over the content of any series in the app. The content produced solely by the authors that write them. If you believe any content is truly offensive and especially if it violates any laws, please [contact me](mailto: aaron@flexile.co).

### Monetary

I do not charge for Readform.

I am not trying to make money off other's people content.

While I do offer a way to "Tip the Developer" in the app, that is purely for the development of the app itself.

### Not eBooks

I want to make clear that all the series in Readform are _not_ ebooks. They are not something you purchase and own and Readform is not designed (nor can it) replace eBooks release by authors. Even though Readform transforms website into an "eBook-like" format, eBooks are something you purchase and own. They also tend to be edited in a more professional manner than series released on the web.

_If an author releases an eBook, I highly encourage you to purchase it!  It's a great way to support them._
