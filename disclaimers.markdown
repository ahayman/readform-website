### Breakable

Readform may break at any time. It's not consuming any set API because there is none to consume (that I can find). Instead, it accesses the raw html and scrapes the data it needs from it. Because of this, there is no guarantee of data consistency. Changes to a website's structure could easily break what Readform is doing.

If this happens, I will work to fix the issue as quickly as I can.

### No Ownership

I claim no ownership or responsibility over the content of any series in the app. The content produced solely by the authors that write them. If you believe any content is truly offensive and especially if it violates any laws, please contact the Provider of the Series. If it's an independent series, please [contact me](mailto: aaron@flexile.co).

### Monetary

I do not charge for Readform.  While I do offer a way to "Tip the Developer" in the app, that is purely for the development of the app itself.

### Not and eBook

I want to make clear that all the series in Readform are _not_ ebooks. They are not something you purchase and own and Readform is not designed (nor can it) replace eBooks release by authors. Even though Readform transforms website into an "eBook-like" format, eBooks are something you purchase and own. Readform content will disappear if the source it relies on public website data.

_If an author releases an eBook, I highly encourage you to purchase it!  It's a great way to support them._
