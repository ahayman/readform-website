Okay, first post and the site's now live. That's one big step out of the way.

Most of the iOS development is essentially done. It's really unfortunate that any individual series will take so much effort to add, but I think the effort will be worth it in the end. Eventually, I need to figure out a way to automate the process.

Next step is to request permission from Providers and Authors. I'm admittedly nervous about this. Many authors release eBooks of their work and I sincerely hope they won't view Readform as a kind of competition. My hope is that they will see the value here in giving their readers a better experience while also offering books/ebooks their users can purchase and own for themselves (something not possible with Readform).

So, we'll see.

No matter how it goes, Readform will be a pivotal piece for me when I eventually begin releasing my own web series.
