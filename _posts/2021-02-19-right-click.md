So, all of a sudden my mouse starts acting funky.  I can sort of click on things, but I can't double click. Sometimes when I click, I get a menu, sometimes not. I can't right click. I can drag things but I can't drop them. I can't open stuff with my mouse at all.  Some apps seem to work, others don't respond.

Fine, whatever Mac. You wanna be like that, I'll restart you and while I do it, I'm gonna think angry thoughts about cheating with Windows.

I restart, same deal.

Now I'm just getting frustrated. I unplug my track pad, turn it off. Same deal. I turn off my wireless mouse. I clean my keyboard (ðŸ¤·, could be related). I turn off everything. I try using just my laptop trackpad, but it's doing the exact same thing.

Now I'm getting nervous.  I start thinking about rebooting into safe mode, unplugging all my monitors, whatever, really hoping it's not something Apple needs to fix via snail mail.

But then I have an idea! (yes, these happen... occasionally)

I have a gaming mouse I use sometimes. Maybe it will work. I reach over and pause, only to see it's already glowing. On it is one of my test devices, an iPad Mini, laying directly on the right mouse button.
