## Sorry!!!

**Readform is not available yet**

iOS and iPad development are finished and feature complete. My next step is to request permission to add content to Readform from Authors and Providers. Once I have that permission, I'll release a Beta (Testflight) build for testing. Assuming everything goes well, I'll release the app on the App Store.

## Development Status

- iPhone & iPad: Feature Complete
- Android: In Development (~40% complete)
- Mac app: 30%-50%? Unsure. Much of the iOS code can be reused, but this isn't a priority right now.
