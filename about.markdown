![Profile Pic](/assets/images/profile_pic.png)

Software developer, avid fiction reader and, maybe someday, a writer.

I've been developing software for over twelve years now, focusing mostly on mobile and front-end web development along with a smattering of server development.

I originally developed Readform as a way for me to read web series without having to deal with the frustration of managing browser tabs. I've also been working on my own fiction and have thoughts of releasing it as a web series some day. If I do, I want to give readers the best possible reading experience.

I live in Central Pennsylvania with my wife and three young kids.
