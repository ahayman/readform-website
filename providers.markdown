Literally none. All of the examples I provide on this website are currently working, but I don't have the permission yet to include them in the app.

**I will never add content without the content provider's or series author's permission.**

If you are an Author or Content Provider, please [contact me](mailto: aaron@flexile.co) to add your content to Readform. However, I'm a single developer working on this in my spare time, and it can take quite a few hours to add just a single series.  So I'll be priorities Providers (like RoyalRoad), which can host any number of series.

I'll also prioritize Authors that have Lore or a Glossary, as that's one of the key features for Readform.

My first goal will be to include RoyalRoad. They don't have any mobile app and, from what I understand, don't have the resources to create one. I hope to convince them to allow me to use their content in my app.

From there, I plan on contacting individual authors to get their permission.
