Currently, I've only added a limited number of Providers and individual series. Most of these are from sources I read myself. 

If you are an Author or Content Provider, please [contact me](mailto: aaron@flexile.co) to add your content to Readform. However, I'm a single developer working on this in my spare time, and it can take quite a few hours to add just a single series.  So I'll be priorities Providers (like RoyalRoad), which can host any number of series.

I'll also prioritize Authors that have Lore or a Glossary, as that's one of the key features of Readform.

Currently I've written code for the following:

 - A couple of independent Web Series I personally read (ex: Wandering Inn)
 - Royal Road
 - Archive of our Own (AO3)
