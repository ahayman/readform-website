# Readform

Readform allows you to read serial fiction on the web in an e-book-like format. I'm currently writing the iOS app as a proof of concept.

Once I get approval from authors and providers, Readform will be released at a Testflight beta. Assuming that goes well, it'll be released to the app store.

## Why?

If you've ever tried reading a book off a website, you should know exactly why:

- Paragraphs are sectioned into blocks (and if you like that, yay for you— I certainly don't).
- Chapters are just long runs of scrollable text. Bump your trackpad or scroll wheel and whoops! Have fun finding your place again!
- Colors are non-negotiable.
- It's easy to loose your place, and god-forbid you accidentally close your browser.
- Trying to keep your place across multiple devices is its own special kind of hell.
- Keeping up with multiple series is not just a pain, it's nigh impossible.

I love reading fiction and there's a ton of great stuff out there. A lot of it is written up and stuck on individual websites where anyone can come enjoy if only you're willing to brave a reading format that's extremely hostile to... well, readers.

I want to change that.

## How

How is easy: I'm a software developer who loves fiction. Software + Love-of-Fiction = Readform!

_However,_ I have neither the time or the resources to develop an entire platform...yet. So I'm starting with an app first. This means I have to get the data directly from the source: websites.

How? By the power of— mwa ha ha —[Regular Expressions](https://xkcd.com/208/)

Yeah, I'm basically scraping websites and turning them into e-books.

However— a big freaking _however_: I will not do it without the author's or provider's permission...

...publicly. (yeah, my personal builds have all my favorite series. So sorry!)

## How can I add my Book/Series?

[Ask me.](mailto: aaron@flexile.co)

I guarantee nothing, though.

I have this fantasy that Readform will become popular. It's also my nightmare. Cause on the one hand, I _want_ people to use and love my app. On the other, it takes over a day's worth of work to add a single series. And let me be clear, I've got a full-time job, a wife, and three young children. I do not have a whole lot of time here.

For that reason, I'll prioritize getting Providers (Platforms that host content, like RoyalRoad) over individual series.
