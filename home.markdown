# Readform

Readform allows you to read serial fiction on the web in an e-book-like format. I'm currently writing the iOS app as a proof of concept.

## Why?

If you've ever tried reading a book off a website, you should know exactly why:

- Paragraphs are sectioned into blocks (and if you like that, yay for you— I certainly don't).
- Chapters are just long runs of scrollable text. Bump your trackpad or scroll wheel and whoops! Have fun finding your place again!
- Colors are non-negotiable (-ish? — I'll admit, browser plugins can fix some of this).
- It's easy to loose your place, and god-forbid you accidentally close your browser.
- Trying to keep your place across multiple devices is its own special kind of hell.
- Keeping up with multiple series is not just a pain, it's virtually impossible.

I love reading fiction and there's a ton of great stuff out there. A lot of it is written up and stuck on individual websites where anyone can come enjoy if only you're willing to brave a reading format that's extremely hostile to... well, readers.

I want to change that.

## How

How is easy: I'm a software developer who loves fiction. Software + Love-of-Fiction = Readform!

_However,_ I have neither the time or the resources to develop an entire platform, so I'm starting with an app first. This means I have to get the data directly from the source: websites.

How? By the power of— mwa ha ha —[Regular Expressions](https://xkcd.com/208/)

Yeah, I'm basically scraping websites and turning them into e-books. This is an odd gray area, though. Technically, all I'm doing is displaying websites in a very specific way to make it easier for readers. Everything I access is public content, I don't claim any of this content as my own, and I'm not charging for the app (nor will I) so there's no legal issues here.

However, I also recognize some authors or providers may not like this. If any author asks me to remove their content, I will. I can think of a few reasons they might:

- The author is selling books separately and fears my app will detract from sales. I personally doubt this would happen. Amazon (and other book providers) are a _marketplace for buying books_. The biggest advantage for using them is exposure to a new market, but it's also about ownership. You buy the book, you own it. It's yours. With Readform, this is not true. You're still reading from a website, even if the format is much more pleasant. If the website goes away (or stuff in the website goes away), that content will go away in Readform the next time it syncs.
- They may be trying to monetize their content through ads. I will never put ads in my app. Period. I hate them. But I also understand that some authors make money this way and while I disagree with your approach, I will always respect your decision and remove content if asked.
- Because Readform executes no javascript, it bypasses a lot of analytics software. Unless the server itself is keeping track, Readform readers may not show up in analytics software.  Also, other "features" that depend on javascript (ex: comments) won't show up as well. While Readform does make it easy to visit the website, this is still indirect. I recognize this may be a deal breaker for some, but I honestly don't have a way to address it (yet?). I'm open to suggestions.

My belief is that by making Web Novels easy and pleasant to read, Readform will help authors attract more readers than ever, which should result in more financial support via Patreon, Book sales, etc. I know that I personally would never had read most web novels simple because it's too much of a pain to read a book via a website. With Readform I do, and I support many of those authors now.

## How can I add my Book/Series?

[Ask me.](mailto: aaron@flexile.co)

I guarantee nothing, though. Sorry.

I have this fantasy that Readform will become popular. It's also my nightmare. Cause on the one hand, I _want_ people to use and love my app. On the other hand, it takes over a day's worth of work to add a single series. And let me be clear, I've got a full-time job, a wife, and three young children. Also, I'm working on my own Web Novel (unreleased). I do not have a whole lot of time but I will make my best effort to add as much content as I can.
